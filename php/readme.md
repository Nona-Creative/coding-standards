# PHP
Our primary, and regular, use of PHP is in WordPress, though we're aiming to use the 'popular' PSR PHP coding standards, over the wordpress standards.


## PSR 
These can be found [here](https://github.com/Nona-Creative/fig-standards/tree/master/accepted), the most relevant ones are:

* PSR-1 : defines basic coding standards
* PSR-2 : coding style guide
* PSR-4 : autoloading

PSR 3, 6, & 7 refer to logging, chaching and http messages respectively, and should be referenced if you need these.


## PHP Best Practice
For general patterns, and good practice we should reference "php the right way", this is an extensive resource, its great whether you're starting out with PHP, or looking for more advanced information.

[Read "PHP the Right Way"](http://www.phptherightway.com/)

Another great general resource is the 10up engineering site, which covers performance, security, design patterns and more.
