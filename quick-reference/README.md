# Quick Reference

## General
- single line comments //
- 2 space indentation
- new line at the end of file
- comma space for multiple values
- else if not elseif
- } else if { on one line
- namespacing files and folders in a better fashion
- removal of unused files
- removal of code is preferred to addition of code
- no 1yr+ snippets, write fresh code, don’t copy paste
- Use the processes and tools we use now - if not sure, ask
- Dev urls: It’s suggested to use dev.whatever.it.is - that way everything works seamlessly, and passwords are able to be used across subdomains

## PRs
- PR must be as small as possible (1 PR = 1 Feature)
- do NOT mix formatting / cleanup work inside a feature PR
- either: feature/ fix/ or release/
- PRs can only go in once enough people have approved - no more just merging
- No committing of autogenerated code (public, lib/vendor, node_modules etc)
- No committing of secrets (like the config file)

## Comments
- Comment all the things. Always.
- Leave extremely verbose comments, please explain your work as you go as much as possible, and be super explicit. Future you will thank you a lot for this.

## PHP
- use [] and not array()
- no trailing commas
- sanitize get vars
- no spaces inside of ()
- new line for multi dimensional arrays with more than one entry
- use single quotes where possible
- one space between closing loop/if condition and { e.g. "if(true) {"
- space between if and () e.g. "if()" should be "if ()"
- php opening/closing tags on their own lines
- use !== instead of != 
- use === instead of ==

## Wordpress
- use get_stylesheet_directory_uri(); VS get_template_directory_uri();
Reason:  this function will act the exact same when not using a child theme but using template_directory in a child theme will actually look into the parent theme which can cause great confusion.

- When linking to home page, can use: href="/" instead of esc_url(home_url('/'));

- Plugins
-- No more plugins unless they’re 150% needed
-- Rather use libraries and do things ourselves - which is (a) quicker (b) safer (c) more extensible (d) unbloated
-- No editing of 3rd party plugins (there are processes for when we need to really really make changes to 3rd party plugins but it should be extremely rare)

## JS
- use [] and not array()
- no trailing commas
- sanitize get vars
- declare variables with 'let' as opposed to 'var' where possible (es6)
- no spaces inside of ()
- new line for multi dimensional arrays with more than one entry
- use single quotes where possible
- dont use ids

## HTML
- dont use ids
- always wrap text in html in tag

## SCSS
- un-nest css where possible
- don't use !important
- use rem where possible
- spaces between > a , li > a:hover e.t.c
- no floats allowed, only use flex box
- more verbose class names
- fine grained element targeting instead of something > div
- better flexing and consistent layout on different widths
- when using background images, always set the width and height to the actual image dimensions 
- when declaring variables: e.g. $base-font: 16; (Colon against the variable, one space, then value)

## File permissions
- Be aware of file permissions
-- All files only ever 644
-- All folders only ever 755
-- Must chmod 644 filename before pushing up (dirs are 755)

## Image compression
- Compress SVGs with svgo
-- svgo file-name.svg --enable='removeViewBox,removeComments,removeUselessStrokeAndFill'
output

- Compress PNGs
-- needs to be crushed going in with pngcrush - http://pngcrush.com/
-- simple pngs need to be quantized with pngquant

## Folder structure
- Images
-- Put images in folders and give images more verbose names e.g. /assets/images/header

- Header css etc
-- Seperate into 2 files _desktop.scss and _mobile.scss in a layouts/header folder

- Header template etc
-- Split into templates/header/desktop.php

## A note about PR Code Reviews - The Nona way

### PRs are now lovingly referred to as “Ritualised Dissent"

What this means is that we all *have* to be as blunt and direct as possible, and we’ve all agreed to never take insult or take it as a personal attack.

So if someone tells you not to do something, or do it a different way, or anything that could be taken personally, please don’t. And just know it’s part of the process, and it has nothing to do with whomever wrote the code

So prepare yourself for “dont do … “ “rather do …” “you should …” “why didn’t you” etc and please be as brutal as possible on others PRs
